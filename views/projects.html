        <br/>
        <p>
          Lane Changer is a traffic management system which provides real time lane change recommendations to reduce commute time and fuel consumption. Special camera systems on roads analyze the traffic flow by identifying vehicles and computing speeds. This data is used to determine the optimum lanes for the vehicles to improve traffic flow. Lane change suggestions based on the vehicleâ€™s route and speed are provided via an app. Vehicles with similar mileages and average speeds will eventually move in lanes which facilitates smooth travel at speeds close to maximum mileage. The journey would become considerably more pleasant which would result in improved productivity and reduced stress due to driving.

          <p>Space Shooter is an arcade game that can be played locally on your machine or using your web browser
           It was developed using the Unity 3D game engine and the assets were developed using the Blender tool. The player is a spaceship which shoots out laser bullets at the incoming set of meteors/asteroids which are destroyed when the bullet hits them. The players get 10 points for each obstacle they shoot down. So shoot down as many obstacles as you can and earn the maximum points. You can also avoid the obstacles by moving your spaceship along in the game area using the appropriate controls.

            <br/>
            <p> The project uses OpenCV on Python to detect cars and detect their speeds in real time. It uses a Haar cascade to detect cars and triangular similarity to detect their real time speeds from the video feed. We can also use a pre recorded video file as input to detect speed of cars in it. It is a great application of the image processing tools such as OpenCV and triangular similarity. It can help you solve traffic issues and speeding promblems on the roads in your neighbourhood.

              <p> Robots are machines which reduce the human efforts in heavy works by automating the tasks
                  in industries, factories, hospitals etc. Most of the robots are run by using some control unit or
                  components like a push button, remote, joystick, PC, gestures and by executing some command
                  by using controller or processor. But today we are here with a Automatic Robot which moves
                  autonomously without any external events avoiding all the obstacle in its path, yes we talking
                  about Obstacle Avoiding Robot. In this project, we have used Raspberry Pi and Motor

                      on a projector and need to switch between applications. You have to move across the whole
                      stage to the podium to use your mouse. How better would it be if you could control your
                      mouse from wherever you were? Well, we have a solution! Mano.
                      Mano is a mouse simulation system which performs all the functions performed by
                      your mouse corresponding to your hand movements and gestures. Simply speaking, a
                      camera captures your video and depending on your hand gestures, you can move the cursor
                      and perform left click, right click, drag, select and scroll up and down. The predefined
                      gestures make use of only three fingers marked by different colours.</p>

                      <br/>
                      <p>A recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the preference a user would give to a product. Such systems are increasingly popular in recent years, and utilized in variety of areas of market. For the recommendation system to work various criteria like previous browsing history of user, purchases, cost preferences etc. are considered.
                          For the development of our project-Hotel Recommendation system, we have used data from two sites- Foursquare and Yelp.
                          Foursquare is a local search and discovery system which provides personalized recommendation of place.
                          Yelp is crowd-sourced local business site where users submit a review of services/products using one to five-star rating system.
                          For the working of recommendation system, data is extracted from Yelp and Foursquare during run time using web scrawlers.
                          Also, we have the datasets of the user-venue based details of Foursquare, which we have acquired from archive.org.

                        <h3>Image Steganography with Visual Cryptography</h3>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Steganography is the science of writing hidden data in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message. Images are made up of pixels. Each pixel represents 3 bytes: Red, Green and Blue. The difference between two colors that differ by one bit in either one red, green or blue value is impossible to detect for the human eye. Therefore, we can change the least significant bit in a byte. This means, we can overwrite the last bit in a byte without affecting the colors. Decryption of the data can be done by subtracting the original image with cover image, leaving behind the encrypted data.

                            Over Image Steganography, we will implement a Visual Cryptography algorithm. Visual cryptography is a technique that allows information (such as text, images, etc.) to be encrypted using encoding system that can be decrypted by the eyes. The basis of the technique is the superposition of two (or more) semi-transparent layers. Individually, there is no message printed on either one of the sheets. Overlapping them creates addition interference to the light passing through.
